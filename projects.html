          <h1>What have I done?</h1>

          <p>Let's not present all the projects I have worked on to learn programming.
            Not that it by any means is that many..

            Here is an overview in the table below. You can see both
            the project and the used programming languages. Maybe it can give you
            inspiration for own projects?
          </p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <th>Project description</th>
              <th>Languages</th>
            </thead>
            <tr>
              <td>Soduko interface and solver</td>
              <td>Java</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Alien invasion arcade game</td>
              <td>Python (PyGame)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Image categoriser</td>
              <td>Python (Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Machine learning bot to play arcade game</td>
              <td>Python, Tensorflow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Healthcare forcasting tool</td>
              <td>Excel, VBA</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Salary prediction model</td>
              <td>R</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>However, there seemed to be some more modern and in the loop
          languages out there. Like Python. And since I happen to like numbers
          and analytics. It seemed like a fit so I figured I would give it a try.
          And since no courses on the topic were offered at my uni, it did it via
          the web, like for this course. With this course, in combination With
          my previous Python knowledge, I hope to be able to display my skills
          on the world wide web. Maybe instead of writing so much static text,
          what if instead let you chat with my alter ego, a chatbot?</p>

          <p>Cool projects that I would like to do ahead (potentially when
            I know some more Python for web development): </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Let you chat with a simple chatbot on the site. Would be cool huh?</li>
            <li>Allow you to play my alien invasion game here. To demonstrate. And
            this site would be a bit more fun if you could play a on would,right?</li>
            <li>Allow you to compete in alien invasion against my mad machine learning
            bot.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Maybe these potential projects are aiming a bit too high but they are doable.
          So let us aim for the stars!</p>
