          <h1>What do I like to do? </h1>
          <p>Hmm... What is the common denominator here?</p>

          <p>Skiing has always been a favorite. But I quickly realized that I
          could make no career out of it. Too far to the good mountains from
          Stockholm, Sweden. But now I have moved to Munich, Germany, near the
          alps! Maybe skiing could be me career!</p>

          <p>Jokes aside. I do love to try out new things, and something I
          am becoming more and more interestest in is programming. Both from a
          data science, business and design perspective. The flexibility of programming
          alows you to create so many cool things and products. And there seems
          to be no doubt that there is a potential career down this path!</p>

          <p>See what skills I've learned and what projects I have taken on
          so far by using the buttons below or the menu up top! Maybe it can
          serve as inspiration for you, if you too are learning to program?</p>
