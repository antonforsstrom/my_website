          <h1>What have I learned?</h1>

          <p>I started of with good old fashioned Java in Eclipse. Better
            start robust with a well proven concept. Well the first programming
            course I took at university was taught in Java so I didn't have much
            of a choice. But java was cool.
          </p>

          <p>However, there seemed to be some more modern and in the loop
          languages out there. Like Python. And since I happen to like numbers
          and analytics. It seemed like a fit so I figured I would give it a try.
          And since no courses on the topic were offered at my uni, it did it via
          the web, like for this course. With this course, in combination With
          my previous Python knowledge, I hope to be able to display my skills
          on the world wide web. Maybe instead of writing so much static text,
          what if instead let you chat with my alter ego, a chatbot?</p>

          <p>Java and python are two of the programming langueges I have come across.
          But since I am a generalist rather than a specialist.. I have breifely
          explored more of the languages out there. For example: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>R</li>
            <li>MATLAB</li>
            <li>VBA</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And oh yeah, of course good old Microsoft Excel. A whole lot of Excel.
          But I guess that is not so hype anymore. Better learn some cooler skillz.</p>

          <p>Check out what <em>projects </em>I have done with my acquired
            programming knowledge.</p>
