# Project 0

This website features a personal "about me" site. It gives a short introduction
to me, my interests, skills and projects I have worked on, focusing on the
topic of programming.

The site consists of four pages of similar structure. The home page is a very
brief and simple introduction of me. It links to the three successive pages:
My interests, My skills and My projects.

Via similar structures of the sites, I have tried to make it easy for the user
to follow along. The user can further navigate via the menu on top of each page
(the menu further indicated which page is currently viewed) or by using the
links at the bottom of each page.

To fill the pages with content, I have included some text about me and my quest
to learn programming.

This website is done as a project in the course CS50 Web Programming
with Python and JavaScript.
